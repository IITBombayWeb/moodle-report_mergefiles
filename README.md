Moodle Plugin for merging pdf files in a course<br>

The ‘Merge PDF Files’ plugin offers the user a convenient way by which he/she can merge the files (only PDF documents) in a Moodle course. <br>
This plugin requires two external tools:<br>
 * PDFtk (short for PDF Toolkit) is a cross-platform tool for manipulating Portable Document Format (PDF) documents.<br>
 * LaTeX – A document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.<br>

The module is created and is currently being developed at IIT Bombay (India). <br>
